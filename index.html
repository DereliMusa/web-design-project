                Tulip, (genus Tulipa), genus of about 100 species of bulbous herbs in the lily family (Liliaceae), native to
                Central Asia and Turkey. Tulips are among the most popular of all garden flowers, and numerous cultivars and
                varieties have been developed. Tulip cultivation likely began in Persia (Iran) in the 10th century, and it
                eventually became a symbol of the Ottoman Empire. Tulips were introduced to the Western world by Augier Ghislain
                de Busbecq, the Viennese ambassador to Turkey, who wrote of seeing the plants in Edirne, Turkey, in 1551 and
                later sent some seeds to Austria. The arrival at Antwerp in 1562 of a cargo of tulip bulbs from Constantinople
                (now Istanbul) marked the beginning of the horticultural tulip industry in Europe. An early recipient of these
                flowers was French botanist Carolus Clusius, who was an avid bulb grower and is often credited with the spread
                of other spring bulbs, such as hyacinths and irises, across Europe. In the 1590s he established a botanic garden
                at the University of Leiden and cultivated tulips there. In 1596 and again in 1598, broken tulips (tulips that
                bloom in streaks or flames of colour) were stolen from Clusius’s garden, and the genetically variable seeds of
                those purloined flowers became the foundation for a lively tulip trade. A speculative frenzy over tulips in the
                Netherlands in 1633–37 is now known as the Tulip Mania.

            <p>Members of the genus Tagetes have attractive yellow, orange, or red composite flowers that are solitary on the
                stems or clustered. The leaves are arranged opposite each other on the stem and are usually finely cut.
                Characteristic bracts (leaflike structures) form a cup-shaped base below each flower head.</p>
